CitationNet visualization
=========================

This FastAPI app generates tree structures for citation (and their citations)
and references (and their references) of a
source publication using data from `OpenAlex <https://openalex.org>`_ and
displays this tree as a 3D network.

The development was part of the research project `ModelSEN <https://modelsen.gea.mpg.de>`_
Socio-epistemic networks: Modelling Historical Knowledge Processes,
part of Department I of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and
funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (Grant No. 01 UG2131).

The work is continued at the department for Structural Changes of the Technosphere, 
Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, Jena.
